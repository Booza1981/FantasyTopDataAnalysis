# FantasyTop Data Analysis

This repository contains a Streamlit application designed for analyzing FantasyTop data. The application provides various tools for retrieving, processing, and visualizing data related to the FantasyTop platform.

## Features

- **Manual Data Collection**: Trigger updates for various datasets directly from the Streamlit application.
- **Data Storage**: All collected data is stored locally in the specified `DATA_FOLDER`.
- **GraphQL and REST API Integration**: Fetch data from FantasyTop using both GraphQL and REST APIs.
- **Environment Variable Management**: Configure your application easily with environment variables.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Booza1981/FantasyTopDataAnalysis.git
   cd FantasyTopDataAnalysis
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` File:**

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file to include your specific credentials and settings:

   ```ini
   TWITTER_USERNAME=your_twitter_username
   TWITTER_PASSWORD=your_twitter_password
   PLAYER_ID=your_player_id
   URL_GRAPHQL=https://fantasy-top.hasura.app/v1/graphql
   URL_REST=https://fantasy.top/api/bids/get-bid-orders
   DATA_FOLDER=/app/data
   GITHUB_PAT=your_github_pat
   ```

3. **Run the Application Using Docker Compose:**

   Build and run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Environment Variables

The application uses several environment variables to manage configuration:

- `TWITTER_USERNAME`: Your Twitter username for logging into FantasyTop.
- `TWITTER_PASSWORD`: Your Twitter password.
- `PLAYER_ID`: The player ID associated with your FantasyTop account.
- `URL_GRAPHQL`: The GraphQL endpoint for FantasyTop.
- `URL_REST`: The REST API endpoint for FantasyTop bids.
- `DATA_FOLDER`: The folder where data will be stored (e.g., `/app/data` in Docker).
- `GITHUB_PAT`: Your GitHub Personal Access Token for accessing private repositories.

### Example `.env` File

Hereâ€™s an example of what your `.env` file might look like:

```ini
TWITTER_USERNAME=your_twitter_username
TWITTER_PASSWORD=your_twitter_password
PLAYER_ID=0xDC0c171F4DB2790e565295c5287bCa9D4071EA1a
URL_GRAPHQL=https://fantasy-top.hasura.app/v1/graphql
URL_REST=https://fantasy.top/api/bids/get-bid-orders
DATA_FOLDER=/app/data
GITHUB_PAT=your_github_pat
```

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Environment Variables

If environment variables are not loaded, the application will notify you with an error message. Ensure that all required variables are set in the `.env` file.

### Docker and Portainer Issues

If you encounter issues with Docker or Portainer, such as environment variables not being loaded correctly:

- Ensure that the `.env` file is correctly configured.
- Restart the Docker containers or the Portainer stack.
- Consider defining environment variables directly in the Docker Compose file for persistent configuration.
